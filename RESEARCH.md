# Research
Ethereum smart contracts and Oracles are quite new technology, so reseach is need to understand the topic and  
to see if it's possible using the Open Data Hub as an Oracle and building smart contracts on top of it.

## What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a decentralized, open source blockchain and at the time of writing the second biggest cyrptocurrency  
by market capital. The big difference to Bitcoin is, that it supports smart contracts to create programs that  
run on the blockchain. So decentralized applications can be build (they are called dApps), the so called Web3.
Applications running on the Web3 can't be censorised or taken down, because they run decentralized and on tousands  
of computers/servers. So to take down or censor such an application, someone needs to takedown the majority  
of the running computers/servers. Another big advantage is that nobody can deny access to this applications.

## What are smart contracts?
Smart contracts are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What are Ethereum Oracles?
Oracles are the connection of the blockchain world with real world data. So for example the Open Data Hub could  
be an Oracle providing the data it has to be used with smart contracts.

## Use cases
A list of possible use cases with the Open Data Hub datasets.  
The main use case for smart constracts is gaming (lottery) or insurances, but you are welcome to contribute  
creative and other use cases.

### Travel insurance
Tourists could create a travel insurance that gets triggered on bad weather or cancelled events using  
the weather and events data.

### Agricultural insurance
Farmers could create insurances in case of bad weather and resulting bad harvest using the weather data.

### Lottery to promote the technology
A lottery based on a estimation of Open Data Hub data like: how many cars will be charged this year?  
To promote the Open Data Hub and the Ethereum technology.

### Lottery to promote green mobility
A lottery once a year that awards the amount of used carsharing, bikesharing or emission numbers as a price.  
For example 53499 bikesharing bikes where used, so 0.53499 ETH will be given to the winner of the lottery.

### Persistent decentralized backup on the Ethereum blockchain
It is possible to store the data (probably not all) on the blockchain as a indipendent, dewcentralized and persitent backup.
Yearly, monthly or weekly summaries of the data could be stored, to save costs and just to show that it is possible.
